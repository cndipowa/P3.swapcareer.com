+ The project is a party invitation/registration site.
+ I collect data from party goers in a friendly manner while keeping the users entertained with pictures that a displayed as event change on the page.
+ The site then uses local storage to store the registration status of the user and mimicks a submission in the process.
+ Minimal information required is the users name and this is checked before persistence to local storage.
+ User have the ability to cancel or clear their registration.

+ A google map is also implemented to guide users from their locations to the party location.
+ All validations are clean except the "&" symbol use in one of the google library addresses.
